Dzip is a compression program with the special purpose of compressing
Quake .dem files. More information on dzip can be found at
http://www.planetquake.com/sda/dzip/

Dzip was originally written by Stefan Schwoon <schwoon@in.tum.de> and
has since been updated and expanded by Nolan Pflug <radix@planetquake.com>.

Dzip makes use of the zlib library copyrighted by Jean-loup Gailly
(gailly.net) and Mark Adler (www.alumni.caltech.edu/~madler). More
information on zlib can be found at the zlib home page at
http://www.zlib.org/   The source download includes the zlib files, they
have been slightly modified from the original version.  All changes are
marked with a comment containing "Dzip" and all were made just to
reduce program size by a little bit.


Compilation instructions:

Compiling Dzip itself is very straightforward;
an example Makefile for gcc on linux or solaris is included.

* For Solaris (or big-endian machines in general), it is necessary to define
  BIG_ENDIAN.


Technical information:

Dzip's demo compression operates in two stages. The first stage takes a
demo  file and converts it into some intermediate format. The second stage
applies standard zip compression (making use of zlib) to the intermediate
format.

The objective of the first stage is therefore to produce an intermediate
format such as can be compressed well by the second stage. Loosely speaking,
the first stage removes entropy from the .dem file format. I won't go into
the details of the first stage here, but if you're interested, make sure
to look in encode.c.
